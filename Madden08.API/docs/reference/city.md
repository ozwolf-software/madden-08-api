# City

The `City` class represents a city that a team can play in.

Cities have a name, region and state, a population, and are flagged whether they can be used in a franchise.

## Regions

Cities are attached to a region in the US:
+ North East
+ South East
+ Mid West
+ North West
+ South West

If you want to change a city to one outside of the United States, select a US region that best represents the climate of your city.
